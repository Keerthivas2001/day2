Day2 task:-

1.The difference between document and window object.

document object:

The document object represent a web page that is loaded in the browser. 
 By accessing the document object, we can access the element in the HTML page.
 With the help of document objects, we can add dynamic content to our web page. 
 The document object can be accessed with a window.document or just document.

=> The document object is a property of the window object.

 => The window object represents the browser window.


window object:

The window object is the topmost object of the DOM hierarchy.
 It represents a browser window or frame that displays the contents of the webpage.
 Whenever a window appears on the screen to display the contents of the document, the window object is created. 

 => The document object represents the HTML document loaded in that window.

 => The window object has many useful properties like the location object and the setTimeout function.
